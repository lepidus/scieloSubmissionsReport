# SciELO Submissions Report Plugin 

This plugin generates a **CSV** spreadsheet with information that is usually requested by SciELO, based on the website submissions. It allows the user to filter submissions within a date interval, using for this the submission date, last decision date or both. The user can also filter from which sections the submissions should be obtained.

Since this plugin can be used in OJS and OPS, the informations change for each application.

The common information obtained for OJS and OPS are:
- Submission ID
- Submission title
- Submitter
- Date submitted
- Days until status changing
- Submission status (queued, published, declined or scheduled)
- Submission section
- Submission language
- Authors (containing full name, country and affiliation to each one)
- Final decision
- Final decision date
- Time in reviewing
- Time between submission and final decision
- Average time in reviewing
- Sections chosen for filtering

The information obtained only in OJS are:
